                    &emsp;Throw The Podium is the first app that I published to the Google Play store in 2018, was created by Unity written in C#. I learned that any app publish an app to the store must be signed. The app was removed from the store because of the Unity-ads problem and all the source code is missing. But the apk file is still available.
